# EPAgent Plugins for AIX (1.1)

This is a series of plugins for monitoring both the OS and application processes (specifically WebSphere Application Server).

aixDiskStats.pl - gathers I/O statistics for mount points.  
aixSVMon.pl - gathers native heap (working storage) statistics.  
nmonLogReader.pl - reads the output from NMON analysis tool from IBM.  
psWASforAIX.pl - gathers usage statistics from WebSphere processes.  

Tested with CA APM 9.7.1 EM, EPAgent 9.7.1, and Perl 5.22.

# Installation Instructions

Follow the instructions in the EPAgent guide to setup the agent.

Extract plugins to <epa_home>/epaplugins.
It **VERY** is important that nmonLogReader.pm is placed in \<epa_home\>/epaplugins/lib/perl/Wily.

Add a stateful plugin entry for NMON LogReader and a stateless plugin entries for all others to \<epa_home\>/IntroscopeEPAgent.properties.

    introscope.epagent.plugins.stateful.names=NMON (can be appended to a previous entry)
    introscope.epagent.stateful.NMON.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/aix/NMON/nmonLogReader.pl -sleepTime 15 -logfileDir "<InstallDir>/"

    introscope.epagent.plugins.stateless.names=DISKSTAT,SVMON,PSWAS,LPARSTAT (can be appended to a previous entry)
    introscope.epagent.stateless.DISKSTAT.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/aix/DISKSTAT/aixDiskStats.pl
    introscope.epagent.stateless.DISKSTAT.delayInSeconds=900
    introscope.epagent.stateless.SVMON.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/aix/SVMON/aixSVMon.pl
    introscope.epagent.stateless.SVMON.delayInSeconds=900
    introscope.epagent.stateless.PSWAS.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/aix/PSWAS/psWASforAIX.pl
    introscope.epagent.stateless.PSWAS.delayInSeconds=900
    introscope.epagent.stateless.LPARSTAT.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/aix/LPARSTAT/aixLparStat.pl
    introscope.epagent.stateless.LPARSTAT.delayInSeconds=15


# Usage Instructions
No special instructions needed for DiskStats, NMON, LPARSTAT, and SVMON.

PSWAS requires that you know the tab location of the WAS application name in the 'ps' output. It is recommended that you speak with your WAS administrator about standardizing the location of that property to ensure consistent results. Adjust the value of '$psCommand' at line 19 of the program.

Start the EPAgent using the provided control script in \<epa_home\>/bin.

##How to debug and troubleshoot the field pack
Update the root logger in \<epa_home\>/IntroscopeEPAgent.properties from INFO to DEBUG, then save. No need to restart the JVM.
You can also manually execute the plugins from a console and use perl's built-in debugger.
